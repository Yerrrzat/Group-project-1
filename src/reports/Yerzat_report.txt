To be honest, I enjoyed working in a group and solving problems together, no matter how complex the problem.
I helped everyone in the project as much as I could, and I am glad that we all did a lot of work together.
One of the tasks for me was creating tables (Orders, Orders_items) where I take a lot of experience. Enjoyed doing a project like this.
The rest of the guys laid out in detail. I mean, how everything works.
Proud of my team.
